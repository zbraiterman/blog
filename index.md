### I've co-authored or reviewed the following books:
* [*Cloud Penetration Testing for Red Teamers* by Kim Crawley](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/security/9781803248486)

### I've co-authored the following publications:

* ["Threat Modeling Manifesto," a set of industry guidelines for threat modeling, which includes values and principles, as well as patterns and anti-patterns](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org)

* ["The XRSI Privacy Framework Version 1.0, a framework for protecting the privacy of extended reality (XR) systems, such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) systems", published by the *Extended Reality Safety Initiative (XRSI)*](https://xrsi.org/publication/the-xrsi-privacy-framework)

* ["The Current Status of Cardiac Pacemaker Systems and On-going Design Innovations."](https://www.amazon.com/Current-Cardiac-Pacemaker-Systems-Innovations-ebook/dp/B083ZSC9K9)  This article will discuss the current status of cardiac pacemaker devices, including material related to the ongoing development of pacemaker systems, such as the main cardiac pacemaker device, programming of current devices and pacemaker leads. The functioning of a cardiac pacemaker system is achieved through the use of a programming system. Each company has usually developed their own programming systems in order to verify the programming parameters, e.g. Pulse Width (ms), Sensitivity (mV), refractory blanking period and amplitude in order to modify specific pacemaker parameters as required. Any modifications in the cardiac pacing parameters are supervised by an EP cardiologist. 

* ["Working with Health Care Facilities and or Health Insurance Providers."](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Health-Facilities-Insurance-Providers-ebook/dp/B083GF3C46)  The responsibilities of the medical device expert are extremely challenging and require knowledge of several different areas. The expertise required by an expert varies, based on whether he/she is consulting health care facilities, liability attorneys (either for the plaintiff or defendant side) or health insurance providers.
Some of the matters on which Experts are required to provide expertise include cybersecurity risks associated with various technological innovations, the effects that these threats have on patient safety, FDA regulatory protocols including premarket approvals and FDA design controls, other medical device regulatory bodies where the device is marketed (e.g. the United Kingdom or Canada), good design practices for all types of medical practice, expertise in the research and development of medical devices, and the proper use of medical devices.
The Expert Witness may be required to develop a written report, which should be based on a rigorous engineering analysis of the device, complete understanding and critical analysis of issues related to cybersecurity vulnerabilities/issues which may affect electronic medical record systems, medical emergency system alerts primarily used in critical care settings, knowledge of proper functioning of the device and all recent IT system updates, as they relate to the potential cause(s) of a device or system failure which poses risk to the safety of the patient or has not provided the appropriate therapy for which it had been designed.

* ["Ask.Cyberinfrastructure.org: Creating a Platform for Self-Service Learning and Collaboration in the Rapidly Changing Environment of Research Computing."](https://www.academia.edu/73629465/Ask_Cyberinfrastructure_org_Creating_a_Platform_for_Self_Service_Learning_and_Collaboration_in_the_Rapidly_Changing_Environment_of_Research_Computing)  Ask.Cyberinfrastructure (Ask.CI) is the Q&A site for Research Computing, was launched at PEARC18 with the goal of aggregating answers to a broadspectrum of questions that are commonly asked by the research computing community. As researchers, facilitators, staff, students,and others ask and answer questions on Ask.CI, they create a shared knowledge base for the larger community.

* ["Progress Update on the Development and Implementation of the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research & Education Facilitators Virtual Residency Program."](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325154156_Progress_Update_on_the_Development_and_Implementation_of_the_Advanced_Cyberinfrastructure_Research_Education_Facilitators_Virtual_Residency_Program) Cyberinfrastructure facilitation – working directly with researchers Cyberinfrastructure facilitation – working directly with researchers 2 technical content that facilitators need is available via other opportunities). The VR consists primarily of (a) summer weeklong intensive workshops that provide both content and experiences in facilitation, (b) biweekly conference calls that expand upon both the kinds of topics introduced in the workshops and additional content and experiences, (c) meetings at national conferences and (d) a grant proposal writing apprenticeship. Current efforts focus on extending the VR model to intermediate and advanced levels, as well as disseminating a “train-the-trainers-of-trainers” approach to teaching other organizations to conduct their own VR activities within their own CI Facilitator communities, in order to expand the VR's scale, scope, and reach. The VR program and its offshoots have already served 336 CI professionals at 185 institutions across the US and internationally. Current Virtual Residents are now positioned to advance to the intermediate level and beyond, and ultimately to become institutional and national CI leaders. This paper will review accomplishments and share future plans.
