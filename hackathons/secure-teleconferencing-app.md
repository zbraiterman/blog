# Teleconferencing Application Security Hackathon

From an [OWASP Women in AppSec, Diveristy and Inclusion Committee meetup I hosted on Saturday, October 3, 2020]( https://www.meetup.com/womeninappsec/events/273377970)



Happy Cybersecurity Awareness month!

We’ve been shifting our work, school and social interactions to remote communications for nearly 6 months due to social distancing orders. During this transition, we’ve increased usage of one or more teleconferencing apps.

This remote Hackathon will serve as an opportunity to exhibit your security knowledge by customizing features of your own teleconferencing app proof of concept. You’re encouraged to consider the following features (and any others that may come to mind) in your designs:

* Meeting invite links
* Meeting host controls
* Meeting attendee privileges and access controls


**A special thanks to those who made this hackathon possible!**

* Zoe Braiterman

* Li-Ann Wong

* Mariah Possobom
