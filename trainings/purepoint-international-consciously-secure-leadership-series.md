My name is Zoe Braiterman, and Iâ€™m a Security Consultant with [PurePoint International](https://purepoint-international.com/). 

The safety and security of one community is BOUND the safety and security of another community.


The Consciously Secure Leader Series, and our brand Consciously Secure Living, is to address unique and important concerns raised by members in our PurePoint community to support our leaders where they are and talk about all topics related to safety and security for human beings, and help leaders create inner security so they can create outer security for those they care about most (teams, communities and families). As a cybersecurity company, leading in crises is what we do consistently, and at PurePoint International, we, too, are committed to meeting our clients and our community where they are. Whether they are a business partner, peers, client, friend, part of our Consciously Secure Mediation community - all are Consciously Secure Leaders. They are innovative, diverse, inclusive, forward-thinking, socially conscious people. They are not just concerned about themselves or their businesses, but those they care about and love most in their workplace and community, and of course, this planet we all call home.


Community guidelines:
